## An experimental conversion from Swift 2.3 to Swift 4

Converted by OOPer in cooperation with shlab.jp, on 2016/10/02.
Swift 3 to Swift 4 conversion on 2017/10/30.

CAUTION
-------
This project is just an experimental conversion from the original sample code of Apple in Swift 2.3 into Swift 4, and in a state "just compiles and starts without crashing". Most functionalities are NOT tested. I really welcome your reporting malfunctioning caused by my conversion. Attaching some info about how Apple's original code works would be very much appreciated.

When Apple has released an official Swift 4 version of this sample code, this repository will be removed.

As this is a simple experimental conversion from the original sample code, "redistribute the Apple Software in its entirety and without modifications" would apply. See LICENSE.txt .

Most functionalities are NOT tested.

You should not contact to Apple or SHLab(jp) about any faults caused by my conversion.
